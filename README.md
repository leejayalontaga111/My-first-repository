## 🎬 My Favorite Movie: Johnny English (2003)

This movie is a hilarious spy-comedy and a favorite of mine. It stars **Rowan Atkinson** (famous for *Mr. Bean*) as the main character.

### What it's about
The plot is a parody of James Bond. After all the other top agents are eliminated, the clumsy and bumbling Johnny English is the *only* spy left to protect the Crown Jewels of England.

> "He knows no fear. He knows no danger. He knows nothing."

### Key Characters:
* **Johnny English:** The confident but incompetent MI7 agent.
* **Bough:** His loyal and much more intelligent sidekick.
* **Pascal Sauvage:** The villainous Frenchman who plots to steal the throne.
